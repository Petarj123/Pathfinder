# Pathfinder

Description

Pathfinder Visualizer is a tool for visualizing and understanding various pathfinding algorithms. The application allows users to create their own grid-based maps and run different algorithms on them. Current algorithms supported are Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* Search, Bidirectional Swarm, and Breadth-First Search.

Usage

Follow the instructions below to interact with the Pathfinder Visualizer:

Draw walls on the grid by clicking and dragging your mouse.

Create a start node by pressing Shift + MB1.

Create an end node by pressing Ctrl + MB1.

Choose your preferred pathfinding algorithm from the selection menu: Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* Search, Bidirectional Swarm, Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search.

Algorithms

Dijkstra's Algorithm

This is a classic algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes. It's guaranteed to find a shortest path if one exists.

A* Search

A* Search is a popular and fast pathfinding algorithm that uses heuristics to guide its path search. It's guaranteed to find a shortest path if one exists.

Bidirectional Swarm

This algorithm works by simultaneously searching forward from the start node and backward from the end node, hence 'bidirectional'. It's extremely fast and efficient but doesn't guarantee the shortest path.

Breadth-First Search

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a simple algorithm that explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It's slower than the other algorithms, but it always finds a shortest path if one exists.
